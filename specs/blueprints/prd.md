## Phase 1: Foundation (Current - Q4 2025)

### Institutions Management

**Objective:** Enable dynamic, slug-based institution pages on the frontend.

**Requirements:**
- Create an `institution` content type with fields:
  - `id` (auto-generated, unique identifier)
  - `name` (string, required, unique) — Display name of the institution
  - `slug` (UID, unique) — URL-friendly identifier, derived from name
  - Timestamps (auto-generated by Strapi)

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/institutions` — Fetch all institutions with pagination
- `GET /api/institutions/:id` — Fetch a single institution by ID
- `GET /api/institutions?filters[slug][$eq]=example-slug` — Fetch institution by slug

**Permissions:**
- Public read access (find, findOne)
- Admin-only write access (create, update, delete)

**Status:** In Progress
